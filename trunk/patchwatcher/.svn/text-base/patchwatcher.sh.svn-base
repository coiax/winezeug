# Simple continuous build for Wine 
# Copyright 2008 Google (Dan Kegel)
# License: LGPL
#
# Watches the wine-patches mailing list, builds incoming patches against
# current git, runs conformance tests.  
# Results sent out via email and uploaded to a web site.

# Warning:
# This script executes source code sent in by anonymous users,
# and is therefore very dangerous.  Run this in as isolated
# and low-privilege environment as possible.
# The ftp account you upload results to should also have as 
# few permissions as possible, and should not be able to write
# anything interesting.
# TODO: merge chroot code, e.g. Ambroz's, see
# http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2008-August/068037.html

# Prerequisites:
# Must do
#    sudo apt-get install libmail-pop3client-perl 
#    sudo apt-get install libmime-perl
#    sudo apt-get install mailx
# and make sure mailx can send mail before running first time.
# (You may need to do sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config.)
#
# Must set environment vars to point to a mailbox subscribed to wine-patches
#   PATCHWATCHER_USER=user@host.com
#   PATCHWATCHER_HOST=mail.host.com
#   PATCHWATCHER_PASSWORD=userpass 
# before running.  
# All messages will slowly be deleted from the mailbox as this script runs.

# Must set envionment vars to point to an ftp account:
#   PATCHWATCHER_FTP=ftp.host.com
# This script assumes that you have configured ftp (perhaps via ~/.netrc)
# with the username and password to allow the script to upload to the
# results directory at $PATCHWATCHER_FTP via ftp.

# Must set env vars to point to the web page results will appear:
#   PATCHWATCHER_URL=http://www.host.com/patchwatcher/results
# This should refer to the same directory as $PATCHWATCHER_FTP/results.

# This script configures and builds wine in a directory called 'active'.
# Then whenever it wants to try a new patch, it moves that directory
# aside and replaces it with a copy.
# When it's done trying out the patch, it deletes the copy and moves
# the real directory back where it was.
# All this fancy dancing is just to avoid irritating anything
# that depends on absolute paths being the same as when 'configure' was run.
# The copies sound slow but they only take a few seconds on a 
# modern machine.

Hi!  This is the experimental automated wine patchwatcher thingy.
The latest git sources were built and tested with your patch
"$patch_subject"
Result: the patch $status_long.

You can retrieve the full build results at
  $PATCHWATCHER_URL/$log
and see the patch as parsed at
  $PATCHWATCHER_URL/$patch
See
  $PATCHWATCHER_URL
for more info.
