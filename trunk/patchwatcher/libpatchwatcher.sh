# Library of shell functions to help construct a distributed patchwatcher
#
# These functions are meant to be used by several independent scripts,
# possibly running on different computers, possibly with different roles 
# running as different unix users for security purposes.
# A shared network filesystem is assumed.
#
# Conventions:
# Local variables are lowercase, globals are uppercase.
# Patch series live in numbered directories called jobs.
# Singleton patches not part of a series are considered a series of one patch.
# Each patch in a job is numbered 1.patch, 2.patch, etc.
# The result of patching/building/testing %d.patch is saved in %d.log
# The overall result of a job is saved in log.txt
# The last line of %d.log (or log.txt) indicates success or failure for that patch (or job, respectively)
# In particular, it must contain the string "patchwatcher:ok" on success.
#
# Jobs are first created in the 'inbox' directory,
# move to a directory named 'slave*' while being built,
# move to the 'outbox' directory when complete,
# and finally move to the 'sent' directory after their results are uploaded.
#
# To prevent half-baked jobs from being processed, we use a few rules:
# Jobs are named tmp.NNN during creation in inbox, then renamed atomically to NNN when ready to process
# Jobs are not moved from inbox to a slave directory unless their name starts with a digit
# Jobs are not moved from slave directories to outbox until they contain 
# a file 'log.txt', and that file is created atomically.
