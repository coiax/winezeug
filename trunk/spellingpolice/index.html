<h1>Wine Spelling Police</h1>
So, you'd like to correct some missspellings in comments in the Wine
source tree, eh?  You've come to the right place.  Here's how to
do it, in five easy steps.

<h2>Five Easy Steps to joining the Wine Spelling Police</h2>
<p>
First, read the
cautionary notes in 
<a href="http://kegel.com/kerspell">Spellchecking Comments in the Linux Kernel</a> 
to find out what <i>not</i> to do when fixing typos in comments.
<p>
Second, grab <a href="stop.txt">my custom dictionary</a>
of words peculiar to Wine's source tree, 
so your spell checker can skip those words and not flag them as errors.
<p>
Third, using that custom dictionary, spell-check the wine source file
you're working on.  For instance:
<pre>
$ ispell -p stop.txt -l < ~/wine-git/dlls/shell32/autocomplete.c
</pre>
This will output a list of the misspelt words in that file.
<p>
Optionally, you can use my <a href="lspell-pl.txt">lspell.pl</a> script
to run ispell on just the comments in that source file.  For instance:
<pre>
$ perl lspell.pl stop.txt ~/wine-git/dlls/shell32/*.c
</pre>
This will output a list of misspelled words for each source file you pass it.
<p>
Fourth, go carefully fix the typos in the comments, being sure to
only fix the glaringly annoying ones, and make sure the
source still compiles and passes tests after your changes.
<p>
Finally, post a patch with your typo fixes (and nothing else)
to wine-patches.  Only do a small number of files per week;
nobody likes sweeping changes.

<h2>Preparing a new custom dictionary</h2>
I use the scripts
<a href="lspell-pl.txt">lspell.pl</a>
and
<a href="lspell2-pl.txt">lspell2.pl</a>
to spellcheck the entire source tree in two steps.
<p>
First, I spellcheck the <i>noncomment</i> portion of the source,
saving the list of apparant typos (really, variable names and the like)
to the file stop1.txt, like this:
<pre>
$ find wine-git/ -name '*.[ch]' | xargs perl lspell2.pl /dev/null | grep -v ':' | tr ' ' '\012' | sort -f | uniq &gt; stop1.txt
</pre>

Second, I spellcheck the <i>comment</i> part of wine's source, 
telling the spellchecker to ignore any of the variable names found
in the previous step:
<pre>
$ find wine-git/ -name '*.[ch]' | xargs perl lspell.pl stop1.txt | grep -v ':' | tr ' ' '\012' | sort -f | uniq &gt; stop2.txt
</pre>

Third, I manually edit 'stop2.txt' and remove lines that <b>are</b> 
glaringly obvious spelling errors from everybody's point of view.  
This is a bit tedious, and requires some finesse.  (Don't remove
lines that are jokes or britishisms, for instance.)
<p>
Finally, I generate the custom dictionary by combining stop1.txt and stop2.txt:
<pre>
$ sort -u stop[12].txt &gt; stop.txt
</pre>
and manually removing obvious crap like blank lines etc. from stop.txt.
<p>
There!  stop.txt is now a list of words that are probably not typos,
and should be filtered out when spellchecking.
<p>
Now you're set to use a mass spellchecker on the wine source tree, e.g.
<pre>
$ perl lspell.pl stop.txt `find wine-git/ -name '*.[ch]'`
</pre>

<h2>Other spell checkers</h2>
Francois Gouget has another source code spell checking script that seems quite polished, see
